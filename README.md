- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anttang8! My name is Anthony. I am a resident of the San Francisco Bay Area and I live with my lovely wife and two silly daughters.
- ðŸ‘€ I am passionate about education for kids and currently serve on the School Site Council for my daughter's elementary school.  I typically volunteer at their school garden whenever they have garden help out days. For fun, I enjoy hiking, camping, backpacking, gardening, reading, and board gaming.  I would consider myself as a person who's interested in all those activities, but probably not extreme in any of them.
- ðŸŒ± After being mainly a Software Engineering Manager for a few years, my software development skills have been getting a little rusty, so I'm refreshing my software development skills!

This sandbox is for various work such as Leetcode, Hacker Rack, and other Software Development Questions.
